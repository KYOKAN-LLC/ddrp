# DDRP: Decentralized Data Replication Protocol

DDRP is a protocol for synchronizing small amounts of data across a decentralized network. Its goal is to create a global, decentralized, and permissionless data commons that allows everyone to store and retrieve data from any node on the network.

This repository contains the protocol's reference implementation.

## Documentation

Documentation for both the protocol itself as well as the reference implementation is located at [ddrp.network](https://ddrp.network).

## Getting Started

Check out the [quick start guide](https://ddrp.network/quick_start.html).
